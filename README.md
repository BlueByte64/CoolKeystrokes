<h3>What is a Keystrokes program?</h3> <br>
Its a program that displays on your screen your current input, like keys and mouse buttons. This is useful for some people and for some gamers (or idk). <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How to install</h3> <br>
Just download and double click the .msi file <br>
<br>
<h3>How do i use it?</h3> <br>
You create overlays on the Keys Menu and assign a key to it, then you customize it however you like.
Don't worry, the User Interface is very user friendly thanks to WinUI 3, you should figure stuff out without difficulty. <br>
<br>
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This program only works on Windows and <b> WILL NOT </b> come to macOS or linux systems, for that the whole program would need to be re-written, <br>so dont ask for a port.
<br>
No preview video for now cuz im still developing it
<br>
<br>
<b>The only official place to download the program is on github</b>
<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
